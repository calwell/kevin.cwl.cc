  <div class="article">
    <p>In my <a href="http://blogging-kevin.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-new-dominican-in-january-2011-part.html">last post</a> on the Dominican, I offered an explanation of that
special "thing" that gets me back there time and time again. That thing
is what as made me (some years) go back up to 4 times in a 12 month
period. That's more often than I've been to Vancouver, for those
counting. In this, the second part of the series, I'd like to share some
stories and anecdotes from this recent trip.  </p>
<p>So, on this trip I had some clear ideas about what I was going to do
differently (from other recent trips to the Dominican). One change I was
going to make was to take more pictures and video. I think you'll see in
the next post, that I did succeed in that respect. The sheer volume of
pictures and video I captured was staggering. Another plan I had before
leaving, was to integrate more into the local lifestyle more than I ever
have. To that end, let me explain how some these efforts unfolded.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
Getting local voice and data service (prepaid) was one very important
plan I had. I spent some time online looking up the different phone
companies (Orange, Claro, Vivo) and their frequencies used and network
coverage. Since I'm using am HTC G2 - it was clear that Orange was the
network I would need to use. The process itself will be covered in
another post, but I wanted to share some of the fun that I encountered
while trying to get what I needed. The first step was getting voice
access at a mall.  </p>
<p>When I had arrived at the mall and found the Orange Shop - the man at
the counter seemed to speak English great. He was personal able and
seemed also to know exactly what I needed. Then, he said "I need your
passport". My jaw dropped and I said I didn't have it. He then says he
needed a passport to setup and account. Bizarre. This then began a
process of me running between the resort, the mall, and another small
range kiosk in a Super Mercado.  </p>
<p>This little booth was closer to the resort, so it made sense not to go
all the way back to the mall - but when I got there it was busy. The
counter was filled with people, so I just stood behind the person who
seemed to look like he'd be the first to go. Not much was happening when
a person came up to the counter, said something in Spanish (that I
didn't understand), paid and left. I was a little taken aback here until
I realized that the concept of waiting in lines is kind of a foreign one
to many Dominicans. I immediately asserted myself up to the counter and
asked in English for "prepaid voice".  </p>
<p>Wow, that didn't go so good. I got a blank look from that. I sure wish I
had taken a picture of his face. The next thing I attempted was to show
my phone and say "prepago". Well, this was enough for the fellow who
seemed to be squatting at the booth to my right to start speaking in
Spanish and then to me in English and he helped me communicate what I
was after to the person working in the small booth. That worked out,
despite him telling me about 18 times that my phone was still "locked".
That would be one of the many times on this trip I would wish for fluent
command of Spanish.  </p>
<p>My next experience with phone service was while waiting for a bus at the
terminal in Santo Domingo. I had about an hour free and there was
another Orange both just sitting in front of my (while I drink my bottle
of water). Since I didn't have data access an I had recently found out
how to hook this up, I decided I would give this a shot. I spoke to the
lady and said that I wanted "Prepaid data on a USB stick". I pointed at
a picture of it and we were off to the races. One passport and about $30
later, I was set to go. At some point she was trying to explain to me in
Spanish that this access to the Internet was only good for "ono dia".
Ok, 24 hours, that's cool. But, how much data am I able to use? That
question didn't work out so well. What happened next (after seeing she
had a computer) was a comical exchange using the Google Translate
website to translate text back and forth. Since Google didn't really get
the essence of what I was asking it took a few attempts to figure out
the best way to ask my question. Eventually, thanks to Google, I found
out that I would be allotted 1 GB of data for the day while in use.  </p>
<p>The process of bussing from Punta Cana to Puerto Plata was another
somewhat comical process. The cabbie I had met in Punta Cana was great
and dropped me at the express bus to Santo Domingo, which was perfect.
Once we stopped in Santo Domingo at a fairly nondescript corner in the
city, I wasn't aware of this being where I would have to get off. The
bus driver came up to me and was screaming allot of Spanish words but
among them were the "Terminal". He was saying I had to get off. Since my
bag was already out, he directed me to another man who I thought was
going to show me where the Terminal was (I looked around and it was
nowhere to be seen). He went up to a person, grabbed keys and took me to
a car. I hopped in and we were off. I thought "Am I in a cab?" "Am I
going to have to pay for this trip?". After a few blocks, I saw the
large Grand Caribe terminal to the right. The man driving the car helped
me with my bags and let me go and I had nothing to pay.  </p>
<p>After getting to Puerto Plata, my good friend Yanelis was at the bus top
waiting for me. We then went over to her house (via motorcycle) and I
visited everyone until Davi came by. With Davi, we went up to his house
in the mountain and I stayed there for a couple nights. What a
wonderful, refreshing experience. Despite being bitten by mosquitoes
like crazy (I didn't realize that's what the net was for), I was loving
it.  </p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, this is what I saw. Just incredible:  </p>

<p>A few days later, my travel companion Julio decided he wanted to rent a
car for 24 hours. The rental was going to cost $70 US cash (with
insurance). The great thing about this is that Julio wanted me to drive.
You may not be familiar with <a href="http://dr1.com/living/road/3.shtml">the driving differences</a> from Canada,
but many of the rules are different. I find it to be more of a
pleasurable experience to drive there because of how things are more
organic on the road. That was a fun day.  </p>
<p>I'm told (by someone who speaks the language) that I have about 20%
command of speaking Spanish and about 40% recognition of the spoken
language. I have the sense that total immersion in a location with the
language is really the on way I'm going to take myself to the next level
and get to being fluent to a level of 40-50%. What are your thoughts
about learning another language?</p>
