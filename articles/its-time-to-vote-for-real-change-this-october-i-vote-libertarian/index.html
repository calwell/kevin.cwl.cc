<p>Firstly, I want to make it clear, no matter what I say - my hope is that
you choose to do what is so important to our way of life. Please
<strong>vote</strong> in this coming Ontario Provincial Election on October 6th, 2011
(click <a href="http://fyed.elections.on.ca/fyed/en/form_page_en.jsp">here</a> to find your electoral district) and make your <strong>voice</strong>
heard.  </p>
<p>Thank you, now it's time to talk about how I'll vote. In the past
Ontario elections I have voted Green party and if I were to go back
further, Liberal. This year none of those will get my vote.  </p>
<p>This year I vote Liberation.  </p>
<p>Liberation? What's that, you say? Is that something to do with the
Liberals? No.  </p>
<p>The Liber- in Liberation comes from Liberty, not Liberal.  </p>
<p>Liberty is:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions
imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political
views</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the essence of this is that you know what's best for you your
family. <strong>No other authority can tell you what's best for you.</strong> I can't
tell you what's best for you.  </p>
<p>I really don't know why this isn't more popular. Just a couple days ago,
the candidate for the Oshawa Liberation party in Oshawa, <a href="http://libertarian.on.ca/users/matthew-belanger">Matthew
Belanger</a>, was nice enough to meet with me - and I asked him that very
question.  </p>
<p>"We're just not out there. It's hard to get the word out"  </p>
<p>I'll say.  </p>
<p>It's more than hard when you're considered what he calls a "fringe"
party. You likely won't see the Libertarians in any sort of provincial
debate or media platform. Last night's debate only included three
parties. What they're talking about is a massive, no, MONSTER shift in
policies from where we are now.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine completely privatized medicine? Privatized Education?  </p>
<p>Can you imagine all roads privatized?  </p>
<p>Can you imagine the end of welfare?  </p>
<p>Can you imagine the buying and selling beer and wine anywhere?  </p>
<p>Can you imagine taxes being a mere fraction of what they are now?  </p>
<p>What the Liberation party wants is for the Government to <strong>get the hell
out</strong>of our lives (with the exception of a few things) and let us live
the way we see fit. They want to let us keep our money to do what we
think is best for ourselves, our family. Imagine a day when you start by
getting paid double what you have now (after all, <a href="http://www.fraserinstitute.org/publicationdisplay.aspx?id=17626">tax freedom day</a> is
in june). What would you do with it?  </p>
<p>I feel it's time to make huge changes. The oppressively taxed, over
bureaucratic system we're a part of today is NOT working. We're part of
a culture of too much Government and too much entitlement.  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">UPDATE - October
11th, 2011</span> - As it turns out - I live in the <a href="http://www.wemakevotingeasy.ca/en/general-election-district-results.aspx?d=100">WHITBY-OSHAWA</a>
riding and there was no Libertarian on the ballot. I was forced to vote
another party and vote for what I thought was best. I felt, this time
around, that we had very little time to prepare for this vote. The voter
turnout was extremely low - Christine Elliott of the PC party was the
winner.  </p>
