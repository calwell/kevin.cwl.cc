  <div class="article">
    <p>There some basic reasons why I go back to the Dominican time and time
again. Some of that is easy to describe (great weather, good-looking
people, beautiful scenery) - but it's the stuff that is increasingly
harder to describe that I'd like to take a look at in this first of many
part look at the Dominican in 2011. I have written <a href="http://blogging-kevin.blogspot.com/search/label/Dominican">quite a bit</a> about
the Dominican here, and I hope you join me in revisiting a locale that
is near-and dear to my heart.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
This time around I was able to see more of this great country than I
have ever seen. I started in Punta Cana at a resort called the Majestic
Elegance and then was able to get to the "north coast" by bus. This
would be a north-west bound trip through Santo Domingo and around the
famed mountains of the north. On display during this trip was the
wonderful and scenic countryside that is often missed by those that
choose to say resort-bound. The small villages, the great people, the
makeshift stands offering various wares and the sugar cane fields (that
kind of reminded me of looking at corn). The beauty of all this is
breathtaking, and one I imagine the Dominican's take for granted.  </p>
<p>But, the beauty is still not that "thing" that draws me to this place.
It's enough, I'm sure, to draw anyone else what has had the opportunity
to be out here - but It's not what I'm trying to describe. And, as you
might imagine I met a number of folks, both inside and outside of the
resorts I was in. One such fellow was a very helpful cab driver named
Saidoo (I may have the spelling wrong there). His English was great and
very helpful as I enlisted in his help to get me (and my mobile phone)
connected to a local provider. My first interaction with him required
that he take me to a mall, then back to the resort (to get my passport)
and then to return again. The rides were a little pricey, but they wet
down in price as my necessity went up. I appreciated that. He was
incredibly helpful in getting me to the right bus for the start of my
journey and ended up being the man that could get anything I needed.
Saidoo was also very well versed in the bigger picture Dominican - he
was a pleasure to speak with.  </p>
<p>Still though, the helpfulness of everyday Dominicans is not that "thing"
I'm looking to get across. Something here is just so amazing. While in
Puerto Plata, a conversation with my good friend Davi lead to a
startling piece of information. The local "iglesia" or church in the
Barrio had not been paying it's bills. It was past -due on rent for a
staggering 9 months. The big question in my mind was - how the hell
would this place still be here after this long? Davi turns to me,
smiles, and says "They are too well-respected". I really didn't think I
could imagine a Canada or anywhere else with rules like these. Rules
that could be so easily broken because of the enormous respect you may
have in the community. Indeed, I have always known this was a place that
favored "Working things out naturally" as opposed to what is all to
common in Canada "legislatively working things out".  </p>
<p>Oh, and things get worked out roughly in many places too - it's not
always pretty, but the system seems to work and defy what we commonly
accept as Canadians. But, that still wasn't it. While still in the
Barrio, I met Giancarlo, the son of my good friend Martin. It was great
that he had noticed me from previous trips - though he spoke no English
and, frankly, my Spanish sucks. He seemed excited to show me his new
bicycle. I went around the corner to check it out and, wow, it was in
rough shape. The chain was rusted and bent in unusual ways, the center
shaft (for the pedals) was loose, jammed and made riding impossible, and
the bike had a flat on the back. Yet, still, Giancarlo was excited and
clearly wanted to see if I could help fix it.  </p>
<p>I went over and did what I could - the chain was a challenge, but I took
my time to unravel it and get it onto the gears. Good, that was a start.
I asked Giancarlo to go after some tools and he came back with a huge
adjustable wrench - good enough - I can work with this. I loosened the
center nut and found a huge piece (possibly bearings) was missing. Not
good. I had another idea, why not tighten it as much as possible? I did
that and managed to improve the ride-ability of the bike. I then gave it
to Giancarlo and he looked as if I had given him Christmas present. He
went straight to the "tire guy" to get the back tube fixed and he was
riding that bike for the entire week (and getting flats) while I was
here.  </p>
<p>This is the lesson, and that "thing" that is so hard to describe. I
could call it a certain positivity or appreciation for the things and
friends you have - but it's more. It's this outlook that Dominicans have
that is often described with a "Tranquillo", but to me is the essence of
what brings me back. Problems really do roll of their shoulders. They
appreciate the little things more and let go what they don't seem to
get. They work hard, as a group of people, more than any other people I
have ever met. We have so much to learn from other places, and I would
start by teaching Canada to live a little (or allot) more Dominican.  </p>

Here's video of me working on Giancarlo's bycyle. You also see the
Iglesia at the start of the video.  </p>
