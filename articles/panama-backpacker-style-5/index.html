<p>Day 10 - Bye El Valle, hello Penonomé  </p>
<p>Morning returns and we all have decidedly less pep. No doubt, the
drinking had something to do with it. We all straggle up, Don gets milk
and we refresh the coffee demon. Packing and bussing ensues as we would
head out of El Valle and drop the guys off at the hotel's street in
Farillion. Tania and I stay on the bus and continue to a larger town
named Penonomé - the capital of the province of Coclé. This town is
filled with shops, I even managed to grab a panama flag here - now I
have picked up everything I need. There are all sorts of stores named
"Peter", Casa Peter, Mr Peter, Bla Bla Peter. At one very unusual
moment, I find Internet access while Tania tells me she's going to get
fries at Mr Peter. When I finish and go find her, she's nowhere to be
found! I take my time and walk up and down the street, I get fries of my
own and after about an hour, I decide to head back to the hotel. I was
wondering what the hell happened to her. It was a very interesting
process trying to explain to the man at the counter in the hotel that I
was in room 605 "Seesh, cero, sank-oo" and that I wanted to get into the
room without a key. After much sign language, probably a little bit of
dancing and poor Spanish, the man with the big ring of keys let me in. I
left a note for her and headed out back down the street. It was getting
dark so I was getting a bit worried. While walking back into town -
Tania was coming out of a mall. She had gone to do her nails. All was
fine at this point. We were off to Pio Pio to eat chicken.  </p>
<p>Panama 11 - Penonomé<br />
All in all a low-key day in Penonomé... Not much more than shopping and
hanging out at the hotel, I managed to walk from one end of the town to
the other - the workers were clearly getting a large stage ready for
Carnaval.  </p>
<p>Panama 12 - Penonomé and Sona<br />
Today, the Carnaval starts... There looked to be no chance to get to Las
Tablas so we made the decision we weren't going there. We found some
Americans that were willing to let us crash in their "crash pad", twelve
of them were in the room next to us. Then, Tania found something better!
Professor Ortiz - a local teacher in Penonomé - was willing to rent a
room in his house. Sweet. We headed over there and dropped our bags and
headed to my MAIN point of interest in Panama - Sona (well known for the
location of the key prison in the show Prison Break). The 200km bus ride
would cost no more than three bucks, but take a good three hours each
way, we needed to get on two different busses. Once in Sona it was clear
that this small town had no clue what type of fame has been brought to
them, or why. While asking a police officer to take a picture with me,
the description of the TV show "Prison Break" elicited deep, blank
stares. They would end up saying a forceful no to any sort of pictures.
I ended up with a picture at a local bank that said Sona. We stopped at
a local chicken place for amazing rotisserie and then jumped on the bus
back to Penonomé ...  </p>
<p>The bus to Santiago was cool, but the bus from there to Penonomé was
horrible! It was impossible to see out the windows to tell where you
were - or even to tell if you had gotten to Penonomé , or if you were
actually there. Tania asked again and we finally made it to where we
were going.  </p>
<p>Right when we returned we connected with Kimmie an Jesus be checked out
the Carnaval that was going on.. It wasn't busy yet, but the people were
coming in to town in droves. I cut the night short because I wasn't
feeling so good.. Back to Prof Ortiz house...</p>
