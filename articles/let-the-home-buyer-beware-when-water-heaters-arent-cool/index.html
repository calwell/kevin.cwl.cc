<p>I'm a new home owner, and as such, not an expert in real estate. With
all the things that happen when one buys a house, you'd be hard pressed
to understand every nuanced part of every deal. Today while looking at
some paperwork, I discovered how the previous homeowners pulled
something of a trick on me and how I should have been more diligent
about the process. Hopefully after seeing this, you'll be more watchful
of your own home buying process.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
I do have egg on my face over this - but more than looking like a fool -
I wanted to share how others might avoid this sort of pain and
frustration in the future.  </p>
<p>Today, a fellow from National Home Services came to the house trying to
sell (for the hundredth time) a new water heater. He was fairly rude and
I tried to be as courteous as I could. It appears there is no way to
stop these people from coming to your door. I had heard about National
Home Services, but did not really know much more than the fact that I
see them on my Enbridge bill. Since I had never signed a contract with
them, I would not be subject to the horror stories others mention. But,
I had always wondered why they are charging me for a water heater.  </p>

  What I see on my bill every month</p>
<hr />
<p>So, today I took the step of calling them and asking what the nature of
my business with them was. The woman on the other end first asked for my
address and I gave it to her. Then she asked for my home sales agreement
- this was a little too much information to give out - so I refused this
request. She seemed quite perturbed by my refusal to provide
information. But, she was willing to assist and offered to send me the
current agreement they had that was in a previous owner's name. That
agreement was signed by the previous owner on July 15th, 2008. I took
over the house somewhere around August or September of 2008, so this
happened JUST before I moved in. The woman from National tells me this
contract is a 15 year contract and to get out of it, I would have to pay
a $575.00 cancellation fee.  </p>

  Hey, that's not me</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, the reason why the woman at National Home Services wanted to see my
agreement was because of one simple line that would either stick me for
the contract or allow me to get out of it. This is item #6 of a typical
contract that determines what stuff the new owner takes on. In my case
it says "Hot Water Tank".  </p>

<p>Are you seeing this? Some of the more astute of you might be able to see
past my boneheadedness and see what's going on here. The previous owner,
in a pinch decided that the house sale would look much better with a
<strong>SHINY NEW</strong> hot water heater decided to sign a 15 year contract with
National Home Services just before selling and then slyly include that
in the sales agreement passing it off to me. As a first time,
inexperienced home buyer, I didn't think to look for that, nor did I
figure it out until some time later.  </p>
<p>How does this translate to money, you ask?  </p>
<p>For the life of this contract to National Home Services, I will have
paid <strong>$2,251.80</strong>(or more considering increases). To continue and
finish the contract from today, I will need to pay <strong>$1,651.32</strong> (or
more) for the rest of the term. To get out of the contract right now,
the minimum charge (cancellation fee) is <strong>$575.00</strong>. Since National
Home Services doesn't even see me as a customer - I also get sales
calls!  </p>
<p>Comparable water heater <strong>$553.00</strong> + possibly <strong>$250.00</strong> installation:
<strong>$803.00</strong> + Taxes.  </p>
<p>Boy, do I feel stupid.  </p>

for a response about a water heater buyout - National Home Services
responded with this message on March 14th:  </p>

<p><strong>$1,039.40</strong> is steep, but it appears the best option I have for the
lifetime of the heater. This will (at least) save me <strong>$611.92</strong> or more
for the lifetime of the water heater. This also gives me the option of a
direct replacement down the road (if I choose to go after a more
efficient model). Perhaps most important, I don't have to saddle the
next home owner with a ludicrous contract if the house is sold.  </p>
