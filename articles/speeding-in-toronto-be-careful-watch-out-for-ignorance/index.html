    <p>Yes, it's those unrealistic cops and other ignorant folks you need to
worry about in Toronto and outskirts. Today, I had a basic exchange with
one such member of the police about speeding on Twitter. The officer,
Tim Burrows, who Tweets as <a href="http://twitter.com/TrafficServices">@trafficservices</a> had the following
exchange with me:<br />
<a name="more"></a>  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

<p><a href=""></a>Now, I need to qualify all of this. Car crashes are dangerous no
matter how fast you go. I have been in a number of them myself as a
driver, passenger and a pedestrian. Always be safe when driving and
*always* drive according to your better judgement (the may not always
be what's posted on a sign).  </p>
<p>Here's the thing, we should all be ashamed of the system we drive in.
The process of catching speeders and other traffic rule breakers is
clearly nothing more than a cash grab, or possibly a tax on us. Let's be
clear, traffic collisions can be scary and dangerous, but most of the
rules we have to follow on the road have nothing to do with safety.  </p>
<p>His basic points were three things (1) speed traps are in plain sight
(2) speeding tickets are revenue neutral and (3) rules are all about
safety. Let's look at these ideas, because you should at least be more
informed than the officer on what we face on a daily basis. Don't drink
his Kool Aid.  </p>
<p>Let's look at this, point by point.  </p>
<p><strong>1. Speed Traps are in "plain sight"</strong> - There are a number of examples
of this being just plain false. The cops in Toronto don't want you to
see them as you approach because you'll slow down, so they resort to a
number of tactics to hide themselves. As a deterrent to speeding, this
is useless, because if no one sees the cop, they are reminded of
nothing, much less that they should slow down. Here are a number of
examples:  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

<p>Found on a blog named <a href="http://spacingtoronto.ca/2008/01/29/are-speed-traps-the-best-us-of-police-resources/">Spacing Toronto</a>, the picture is small, but you
can clearly see that the Police have done what they can to hide
themselves behind the trees. If not for the speeder they stopped, you
would not have seen these guys on approach. Another spot I'm very
familiar with is the corner of Gerrard St E and Blackburn St. This is a
common hidden location for the police to hide and catch those coming off
the bridge covering the Don Valley Parkway. It looks like this (source:
Google Maps):  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

<p>You can probably tell what they hide behind in the summer months, yes,
the trees, the sloping pavement and the fence all create this perfect
way of tricking people into thinking nothing is there. Another common
trick I have seen used is the lone cop standing on a bridge pointing his
speed gun down on the highway below. Once they catch someone, they call
ahead and get a cruiser to stop you. Plain Sight? If you are lucky
enough to catch the cops in the act of hiding a speed trap, I would love
to see the pictures. We have to prove this major fallacy wrong.  </p>
<p><strong>2. Speed Traps/Tickets are Revenue Neutral after all costs factored</strong>
- this is one big example of a fuzzy accounting process. The process
where they count up all the costs to ONLY the parties you deem important
and then leave all the rest out. The costs to those drivers who are
fined at these incredibly high rates are not revenue neutral at all. To
most, the high cost of the ticket is just the beginning. There is the
social stigma attached to being a speeder (more on that later), the high
cost of taking time off work and/or hiring legal representation, and the
insanely high cost of the insurance if you were to be convicted of one
of these charges. In some cases it gets even worse, you may in some
situations have your license suspended (without notification) and/or
face demerit points. Add all this up, and you have an incredible loss of
the little spending money a person takes home after tax - even for the
most minor of speeding charges!  </p>
<p>Look at the number of paralegal companies that exist in Toronto, my
<a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=paralegal+toronto&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=paralegal&amp;hnear=Toronto,+ON&amp;view=text&amp;ei=OqX-S9-UF4H48AaHw5D0DQ&amp;ved=0CEgQtQMwAA&amp;z=12">search</a> on Google yielded 1,333 results! The hide-and-catch speeders
game not only pads the pocketbooks of the Police, it has created an
entire market for legal services. Not to mention that many of these
paralegal companies prey on the more uninformed folks who are clearly
intimidated by the cumbersome legal system we have. That's a post for
another day.  </p>
<p><strong>3. It's all about safety</strong> - This is one of the biggest lies that the
cops will ever feed you. They are not hiding behind the trees with radar
guns to keep us safe (revenue generation). They are not trying to create
the "speeding is criminal" stigma to create a safer road environment
(public support, fear). They don't over-legislate rules like the "racing
law" that get's your license suspended, gets you fined up to $10,000 and
your car towed immediately - because they want safer roads (all of the
above). <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">None
</span>of the current speed enforcement policies or budget goes to
safety.  </p>
<p>What, then, would the Police and Government be doing about all of the
above if they were actually trying to curb collisions and keep us safer?
I'm glad you asked, that is the most important question here. We need to
collectively stop these jokers from screwing us over. I personally don't
trust them with tax money as they stay "revenue neutral". Here's what we
need to go in the right direction:  </p>
<p><strong>Roundabouts</strong>- Many studies have concluded that roundabouts on our
roads reduce collisions. A Washington-based study concluded the
following about roundabouts:  </p>
<ul>
<li>more than 90% reduction in fatalities  </li>
<li>80% reduction in injuries  </li>
<li>40% reduction in total number of crashes  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even an article in <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/united-states/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9621685">The Economist</a> (subscription required). talks
about the benefits of roundabouts. Provinces like Alberta are starting
to install them - <a href="http://www.transportation.alberta.ca/roundabouts.wmv">here's</a> what one looks like. But here in Toronto,
little or nothing but talk. And, how many roundabouts do we have in
Toronto? I'm sure you can count the number with your fingers. How much
of that "revenue" could be spent on roundabouts for safety instead of
more radar or laser guns?  </p>
<p><strong>Speed Limits</strong> - Did you know that the 401's speed limit was actually
112km/hour in 1976 before it was dropped to the current 100/km an hour
(<a href="http://www.roadscholar.on.ca/lateststory.html">source</a>). Did you also know that the minimum design speed of the 401
is apparently 130km/hour? Speed Limits need to be adjusted to be
appropriate to the area they are in. In the case of the above Gerrard St
E speed trap, the road itself is usually heavy up to River St. when you
arrive at the DVP Overpass, and then the road opens up. Those drivers
who enjoy this brief relief of traffic and go faster than the posted
40km/hr speed, are however, clipped immediately by the cash hungry cops.
The speed limits on the roads need to reflect real world conditions, and
not just set (and used) by the police for their advantage. Many other
locations probably deserve lower speed limits, but the majority of the
roads in Toronto have speed limits set WAY too low.  </p>
<p>The key statistic about speed, though is really not that "high speed
kills" as they would have you believe. It is actually the deviation from
the normal speed you are travelling on. Yes, that means Grama driving at
40+km/hr lower than others on the 401 will be MORE of a risk than
someone driving 40+km over the normal speed. Here's a graph to
illustrate that (<a href="http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/speed/speed.htm">source</a>) :  </p>

<p>The speed "stigma" and this the push to make those that might speed look
like criminals - needs to stop. The cops need to stop wasting our money
on hiding in bushes trying to catch speeders and put that money in more
useful endeavors (like building roundabouts, catching actual bad guys,
perhaps?). Everyone needs to call or email their local politician and
tell them that the current policies are unacceptable. When you hear a
cop talk stupidness about speeding policies - correct them!</p>
