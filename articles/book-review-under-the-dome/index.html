  From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Dome">Wikipedia</a></p>
<hr />
<p>As a techie, I am rarely presented the opportunity to read fiction
books. Yes, most of my reading tends to be news, current events and
articles or books related to the (sometimes dry) computer industry. When
I saw Stephen Kings UNDER THE DOME in hardcover hanging on the shelf of
my local Chapters, I was more than intrigued.<br />
<a name="more"></a>  </p>
<p>UNDER THE DOME follows a number of townsfolk living in Chester's Mill,
Maine (King has a thing for Maine in his books). These seemingly normal
people are transformed in crazy and interesting ways as a domed force
field of some kind caps the small town completely. No one comes in, no
one leaves.  </p>
<p>This trapping of the towns people "like ants" is a perfect scenario for
King. His beautifully descriptive writing tells stories within even the
mundane of facts. He really gets into the "why" of what people do more
than any other fiction author I have read (admittedly, not many). Those
little tangents about what people are thinking at moments before or
after things happen are classic King moves.  </p>
<p>More than the descriptions too, the characters are very strong. The good
guy named Dale Barbara is a strong fellow I imagine as big, rough
looking. But with humility. The bad guy - Jim Rennie - is somewhat the
same, but with the look of perfect evil. I can already see who will play
these guys in a movie. I pick Ron Perlman for Barbara and Deniro for
Rennie. Perfect. I can't quite place Junior, but I would have bet that
someone like Heath Ledger could make that part great.  </p>
<p>The stakes are high too. You might not think so, but the kind of crazy
shit that can go down in a small town is really endless. When that movie
is made, it will need some really cool special effects. Also, I expect
this to be 'Hard R' - any less would be a disservice to the amazingly
described gore and horrible acts in the story.  </p>
<p>The gore is not all - I'm fascinated by the technology surrounding the
dome. I wont give away too much about what (or who) creates the dome;
but the tech behind the 15 minute pulses, the small holes in the
exterior of the dome and the level of transparency. King doesn't delve
into this nearly as much as I would liked. I wanted to know more.  </p>
<p>I won't give you any more about the story either - you have to read the
close to 1100 pages yourself. I think if you take the ride, you'll be
happy you did.   </p>
<p>Just a note: it took me seven damn months to read this book. Seven
months! You can grab the book here from Amazon.ca: <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1439196966?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=1439196966">Under the
Dome</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=1439196966" /></p>
