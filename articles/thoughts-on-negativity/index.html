<p>Recently, I read a nice little article on <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/negativity-a-motivation-killer/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+pickthebrain/LYVv+%28PickTheBrain%29">Pick The Brain</a> about the
idea that negativity can be a motivation killer. And another article
entitled <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/why-optimists-prosper/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+pickthebrain/LYVv+%28PickTheBrain%29">Why Optimists Prosper</a>. I find myself in negative situations
all the time. My work can be a cauldron of negativity. Most of what I
generally do is about fixing problems - that's not a situation that
breeds allot of positivity. I too, succumb to negative thought
processes, and when I do, I usually pay for it. I usually snap out of
it, but the challenge has always been to be motivated from a positive
place towards a better future. I have been self employed now for more
than 10 years, a testament to a sort of positive motivation. I have come
across too many folks that, for some reason, are inherently negative and
I always hope to see that change for the better.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=1463541672690543810&amp;postID=5078298117425838461"></a><br />
I'll give you an example, you must know folks like this. Your supposed
to meet your friend/lover/sibling/parent at a later time during the day,
but your still working. So tied up, in fact, that you can't get to the
phone as early as you would like. The day wears on and you finally get
the chance to call and you say that you have to work late and you can't
make it for your date/dinner/meeting/function. What's more, you say you
don't know when you'll be done. Well, the more positive of you would
probably say to themselves "OK, he/she's working late, no big deal. I
don't know the whole picture, but I'll find out more when he/she
returns". The negative thinker will instantly be thinking: "He's going
to be late, he's (done something wrong /cheating / hurt himself/ fallen
off a cliff / hit a moose)" and then that person would automatically
start to feel anxious, or in some cases cry or act out in horrible or
angry ways.  </p>
<p>This tends to be deeper than just flipping out over late appointments,
it's an instant and internal leaning towards the "worst in people"
instead of a positive thoughts. In our daily lives there are all sorts
of things that happen that are positive and negative. You might be
driving along and another driver cuts you off, you flip him the "bird"
and keep driving. Surely, that is a negative thing, but that is not what
I speak of when I talk about negativity. You may be in a conversation
and the person your talking to pisses you off, and in turn you go off on
them and give them a piece of your mind. That's also negative, but not
what I refer to here. These are all expressions of anger and annoyance,
a human emotion. Often anger can be used as a tool to motivate others
(or just as a release for us). Anger is a tool, it comes, goes and it
passes.  </p>
<p>The negativity I speak of is sort of an internal trigger for people.
It's the sort of thing that keeps us from starting a businesses because
of fear, laziness or or lack of confidence. It's the sort of thing that
makes people use humor as a weapon to keep us from seeing their true
sadness (and perhaps them too). This may also what makes so many act out
in selfish or adversarial ways. The instantly negative thinker will
assume everyone is trying to take something from them. I think, in many
ways, this kind of thing is the underpinnings of what we might know as
depression - but I don't say I understand that. Actually, I don't
understand anything about the psychology of this, but, what I do
understand is the loss that comes from loosing loved ones that have
succumbed to this.  </p>
<p>Being overtaken by negativity holds us back in so many ways. It keeps us
from taking the time to understand other's points of view. It keeps us
from looking at or exploring the more important larger picture and
gaining a much-needed understanding. It keeps us from appreciating the
many wonderful things life has given us, often hiding under the surface.
When those that are in the throes negativity need to be motivated, it
does not seem to be possible from within. Struggling towards a common
goal is not possible because the struggle is stifling to them. I have
met a great many greatly motivated, intelligent, and beautiful people
who are held hostage by their own negativity. In many ways it cripples
them all that know them.  </p>
<p>So, why do so many get trapped in this negative mental process? What can
be done to stem the tide of negativity? What if you're doing the things
I describe here?  </p>
<p>I know this doesn't happen overnight, but being surrounded by those that
will support you is important. Being good to those that try to be there
for you - this is hard sometimes - but good things breed more good
things. I feel that, sometimes, forcing yourself to be patient also
helps. Even if the outcome or answers don't exist- just <strong>stop</strong>and let
it happen. Let it sink in until you have more details and you might
simply free yourself from the negative shackles by waiting. Try to
separate yourself from those that bring negativity in your life. Also,
do this with negative influences like gossip or the news, if you can.  </p>
<p>What do you think? Am I way off the mark here? Is there a better word to
describe this than negativity?</p>
