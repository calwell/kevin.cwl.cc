<p>Day 7 - "The People"<br />
Last night was a little crazy, the Clos wine was a big part of that or
"crack in a box" as it would be coined. Tania would get right drunk on
that stuff. My experience in the hammock was not all that good either -
the locals were really partying and I was being eaten by some sort of
painful bugs.. They bit my entire left arm but didn't touch my right
arm, weird. Tania woke me up at 8am with coffee and breakfast. I was not
ready to wake up and she said "Kev, You have to wake up!" - I thought it
was an emergency. When I finally woke up, we were off. There were two
couples of Americans down for a road trip that were really cool and let
us park our bags in their trailer while we were gone. Since the beach
was not going to connect us to the resort (it was right around the
point) - we were going to have to take a water taxi or a bus. We chose
the bus. After a couple short bus rides we were just outside the
Decamron complex. Walking up to the resort on the beach, we met a few of
the folks we knew and they would help in the process of obtaining a day
pass - that was $54.00. It was Pricey but part of the process if we
wanted to stay. We went into the pools , met and hung out with many of
the group members - Tim and Christine were nice enough to offer to let
me stay the night as well as a hot shower, that was nice! We would all
get to the large reservation in the Italian restaurant and party a bit.
I turned in early. Our next plan was getting out at 6am and heading to
El Valle. Our wrist bags only lasted till 2am and I didn't know for sure
where where Tania was staying....<br />
<a name="more"></a>  </p>
<p>Day 8 - Hello El Valle<br />
6am comes and Tim's alarm goes off. I gather my limited amount of stuff
and wait for Tania. After not hearing from her for 40 min I head out to
look for her. She ends up being easy to find and we walk out the front
door of the resort as inconspicuously as possible. There were a few
people that were coming with is on this trip and we were supposed to
meet them at the Santa Clara bus stop in a few hours. We went back to
the campground, grabbed our bags and then headed up to the bus stop more
than an hour early. A long wait to be sure... When they arrive I was
surprised to see how many people decided to come out! Jimmy, Don, Dennis
and Tom all made the trek. We all grabbed a bus - and I even took my
second still picture on this trip to El Valle. This time we would shack
up in a small spot called "Cabanas Pitosi", the room had three beds and
space for two hammocks outside. Once we were situated we headed for the
canopy tour. It was a steep $52.50, but everyone was in and it looked
well worth the price. We all hiked up the side of a mountain and then
zip-lined back down at three points between the trees, at times close to
180ft off the ground. One line was amazing! We were stopped right above
a waterfall halfway across. The view was unbelievable! We also saw
rubber trees and a possible Tucan sighting, though he didn't stick
around. Dennis and Tom decided to return home and Jimmy, Don, Tania and
I headed back to the room, got drunk and slept.  </p>
<p>Day 9 - El Valle<br />
So, I was in a hammock last night at "Cabanas Pitosi" - the one
noticeable thing being how cold it was - but I slept ok. Everyone else
stayed inside the cabin. We woke up to breakfast in bed thanks to Don
and Tania walking to the town for us, it was great! More exploring
needed to happen today though. We all walked into town and rented
bicycles, and then hit the road towards the golden frogs and the square
trees. There were very few golden frogs, but the square tress required
us to follow this great little "sendero". Along the way we came across
these leaf cutter ants.. They were all walking along a path, in one
direction carrying pieces of leaves, in the other direction going back,
this was incredibly organized. After getting to the square trees we
headed to the "pozos de thermale" or thermal pools.  </p>
<p>The idea about the thermal pool is that there is water in a basin being
heated by the lava of the dormant volcano of El Valle. The water in the
pools was indeed incredibly warm to the touch. After paying the $1
entrance fee and seeing the pool - I personally decided to sit it out,
it looked pretty nasty. Don, Tania and Jimmy jumped in and seemed to
really enjoy it.  </p>
<p>By this time Don and Jimmy were considering going back to the resort -
Tania did convince them to stay for a drink at the cabins before going.
When they decided to leave, it was so late in the town that everything
was shut down - the only way to get to the main highway was by taxi, and
they were charging $35 to get back to the resort. Somehow, I totally
missed the pivotal moment, but the decision was to stay another night...</p>
