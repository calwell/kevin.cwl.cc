<p>Over the recent months I have taken on a number of projects to improve
the look this house. In this case, I found a small wooden coffee table
at a Value Village for $19.99 and I saw potential in it. I could
visualize the look of it finished, even as it sit in the furniture
section of Value Village. The table as I bought it was not stained at
all - it had a number of large gashes on the top of it and the varnish
had a somewhat off-color to it. The great thing about this table
(besides the price) was how sturdy it appeared to be built. Nothing
screams "project" like some basic solid wood. I'm going to show you how
to take a coffee table, stain it and make it look great. This can be
done for easily less than $30 ($70, if you can't borrow a sander).<br />

  Coffee Table: The original look of the table</p>
<hr />
<p><a href=""></a>Sanding is usually the most important part of the project. You want
to make sure you get the previous varnish off the wood and yet don't
want to take too much of the wood with it. To start with, I used an
orbital sander with the (Velcro sanding sheets). These are generally
about $40 at a hardware store. I started with 60 grit sandpaper. As I
was sanding I decided I wanted to stain as much of the table as possible
- so I took it apart into pieces. The roof of my truck was quite useful
for doing some of this work from waist-level. Here's a look a piece of
the table and the sander I was using:  </p>

</div>

<p>After sanding everything with the 60 grit sandpaper, I moved on to the
120 grit sandpaper to smooth out the rough surfaces. Usually just two
passes of sandpaper is enough, even though some will tell you that you
need to do a third (possibly with 180 grit). With this finished, I was
happy with the sanding stage.  </p>
<p><strong>Sanding Tip</strong>: Sand in the direction of the grain of the wood. Also, I
was doing all this outside of my garage to keep from getting dust all
over - when sanding, be sure to wear a mask!  </p>

  The small bottle of stain used</p>
<hr />
<p>After the sanding was finished, I started to stain. I used <a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=980260&amp;Ntt=980260&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber">Varathane
Professional Premium Wood Stain - American Walnut</a> (236ml) - for this
job. As you can see by the size of the can, very little stain is
required. This can was half-empty when I started and still has some
stain left - you will not use much of this stuff. I used a natural
paintbrush and simply started to stain (continuing to stay with the
grain).  </p>
<p><strong>Staining Tip:</strong> It's sloppy and tends to really show later if you make
mistakes. I only placed one coat of the stain on the wood - but after
the first coat I took the time to touch up some of the spots that I
missed on the wood. be consistent and even whenever possible.  </p>
<p>After letting the stain dry for a week ( yea, I gave it extra time), I
came back to start the lacquer stage. The varnish is used to protect the
wood and stain and create the finish of the table. For this process I
used and for this I used <a href="http://rona.ca/shop/%7Evarnish-varathane-professional-varnish-flecto-219853_%21varathane_shop">Varathane - Professional Clear Finish (Oil
Int. Clear Gloss)</a> (946ml). The gloss is great for table tops because
it really gives it that bit of shine you notice in a room. For this
project I will put three coats on the wood letting it dry about 6 hours
in-between coats. You'll use quite a bit more of the varnish than you
will the stain, so you want to pickup a larger can - I used the 946ml
size (roughly a liter).  </p>

<p>[<img alt="image" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_gsOoH9Cd_Q0/TCOITqLFlDI/AAAAAAAABF4/BPpziQqRVeY/s320/Varnish.jpg" />][]
  The varnish used - note the "Clear Gloss" - this is shiny</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Varnishing Tips:</strong> (a) give the previous coat time to dry, I gave it
at least 6 hours. I didn't put new varnish on if the surface was still
tacky (b) making sure you paint it all on evenly. This is a challenge
with glossy varnish since it hard to tell where you last painted and (c)
making sure that you do a light sanding or use a scrub pad on the
previous coating of varnish . This takes away the air bubbles and makes
the next coat smoother. In my case three coats was enough.  </p>
<p>One warning, during all of this, water is your enemy. You have to use
varsol to clean the brushes (not water). You have to make sure the raw
wood does NOT come in contact with water or it will stain. I
accidentally rested one of the legs in water (just after sanding) and
here's what that did to the leg. Notice how prominent the stain is:   </p>

<p>Now, the project is finished, the varnish on the table has hardened and
I have to say - I'm very happy with it. This is a definite improvement
over my previous table sanding project. I think I'm learning more every
time I take on one of these. Here are a few more pictures of the final,
stained table. Click through for larger versions.  </p>

<p>I'd love to hear more about your own projects. What did you think of
this? Do you have any staining tips of your own to share?</p>
