<p>Day 13 - Penonomé<br />
Waking up this morning the distinct sound of partying outside was really
cool. I was told that this Carnival goes four days - all day, all night
- and doesn't stop. I decided to walk towards the sounds, I had to
remember where I was.. No street signs here to help. Gathering some
landmarks I work backwards with these:  </p>
<ol>
<li>MUSEO HNOS ARIAS MADRID, turn left  </li>
<li>Corp. el sol, turn right<br />
<a name="more"></a>  </li>
</ol>
<p>I get to see the local Internet cafe - where the access is slow and they
charge .60c an hour, by far the cheapest access in town. The one thing
that is super annoying though, is that they filtered suspect "Porn"
sites. I would be in Facebook and click on a friend's profile and a
filtering message comes up and KILLS the web browser and all the tabs I
have open! Brutal to say the least. That is good enough amusement for a
couple hours, I then grab lunch at Pio Pio, and head back towards all
the action in town. What action indeed! On the main street in town there
are about 8 tanker trucks lined up and down road - the sole purpose of
these being to spray water on the people below dancing in the sun. It
was great, I went in and got wet and sprayed myself, I even got the
chance to hop on top of a tanker and spray the people below! Wow, that
was amazing. So many happy people.  </p>
<p>I ran into Tania and we went to the river where the Queen of the
Carnival was due to arrive - I ended up very tired so I went back for an
afternoon nap... I slept a hell of a lot too .. Waking up sometime
around 8pm, Tania and I walked back into town to eat and get on the
Internet.. The party was in full swing but I was not drinking tonight..
Tomorrow we have to travel to panama city and stay our last day at the
voyager hostel.  </p>
<p>Day 14 - Back to Panama City<br />
Its 7:20am in Penonomé.. Everyone here stayed up all night - so everyone
is sleeping while I'm thinking about breakfast! I leave the house and
headed for a walk - I walk up to the local Pio Pio store and ordered two
scambled egg combos (huevo revoulto) because I was so hungry. I took the
sausages back for Max, the family dog, to eat, and he loved them. I then
worked out the plans for travel with Tania - we would leave right away
on the bus and get to the hostel around 5pm. When we got there we met up
with some really cool Canadian/Dutch/Americans and headed back out for
carnival.. This version of carnival was much different than Penonomé -
this was Pamama City and it was massive!! People in this (possibly
million strong) crowd were throwing confetti on each other (this was the
small circle that is cut out of paper with a three-hole punch).. They
were also spraying some sort of foam out of cans to.. I was constantly
impressed by how nice and welcoming everyone was ... It was a great
party and I ended up drunk and had to stubble home on this one..  </p>
<p>Day 15 - Homeward Bound<br />
Waking up after last nights craziness was cool - I did have to struggle
with confetti all over my body though , that was a real pain in the ass!
We checked out of the hostel, Tania went back to carnival for the day
and I went looking for food - I found a nice little place where I got
some amazing chicken fried rice ... For 2.95 I ended up with a plate
that would feed 5 people!!! I got a doggy bag to eat the rest at the
airport. I was looking forward to getting back home. My ride to the
airport would leave in a couple hours - grabbed two boxes of that cheap
wine for the road and headed back to the hostel. The flight home was
incredibly scary but I made it back! What's Next?</p>
