<p>Here's the thing, I tend to watch a lot of movies. It may be because,
instead of watching TV, I end up watching movies? I'm really not sure
why I have always liked watching movies - and even seeing what it takes
to makes movies. It's all entertainment and escape at it's best. Each
year, I can say I've seen most of what's out there, though some movies
(often Oscar Bait-y types) escape my viewing pleasure.   </p>
<p>This year, there were a number of great and cool movies that I thought
were the best. Some that probably deserve mention, but I haven't seen
are Black Swan, True Grit, Enter The Void, The Kids are All Right,
King's Speech, and Winter's Bone. For the rest, take a look at what I
thought were the best of this year.<br />

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">10. Get Him To
The Greek</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226229/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/offer-listing/B002ZG97PQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=am2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZG97PQ">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B002ZG97PQ" />)<br />
The best comedy this year has to be Russell Brand's return as rock star
Aldous Snow. It almost seems like he was meant to play this character.
Previusly, Brand played this character in another wonderful comedy,
Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I really loved the chemistry between Brand
and Jonah Hill and the cameos alone were funny as hell. P. Diddy was
great here too, who knew he could be funny?. It's mostly stupid and
gross comedy, but there is a serious side there too. This is precisely
the way I would envision the process of picking up a drugged out rock
star.  </p>

</div>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">9. The Karate
Kid</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155076/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003WOUP2Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003WOUP2Y">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B003WOUP2Y" />)<br />
I was really not expecting to like this. The little I knew about it
(Kung Fu as the fighting style not Karate, relative unknown Jaden Smith,
Jackie Chan) - made me think this really was going to be trash. Boy, was
I surprised with what I saw! Smith did a great job of acting like a kid
with a lot to learn, Jackie Chan wasn't doing his regular jokey shtick
here either. The understated nature of nearly everything in this movie
makes it come out as a real winner - and wipes thoughts of original out
of your mind. The fact that it made a crap load of money probably
guarantees a sequel.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">8.
Machete</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B002ZG98CS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZG98CS">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B002ZG98CS" />)<br />
I love so much about this film that it's a wonder why it's not higher on
my list. Machete is the movie trailer that turned into an actual movie.
And that movie is amazing in ways that are unexplainable. Watching Trejo
finally getting a leading role and letting him rip shit up like he does.
Michelle Rodriguez looks incredible and plays a great hard-ass. If you
are a fan of the grind house style movie, this is your movie. And, even
thought it didn't make a lot of money it <strong>made</strong>money. I hope to see
more of this.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">7. Let Me
In</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228987/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003EYVXUU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003EYVXUU">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B003EYVXUU" />)<br />
Let Me In was another of those surprise movies. When I heard that they
were remaking the AMAZING Swedish movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/">Let the Right One In</a>, I was
more than a bit cynical. This seemed too soon for this. What ended up on
screen was incredible for a movie that so many were not looking forward
too. Most of this rested on the shoulders of Chloe Moretz and I should
she did a great job of being strong and venerable all at the same time.
Richard Jenkins was great as the father. Do yourself a favor and see
both Let the Right One In and this movie.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">6.
Buried</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462758/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003L20IFQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003L20IFQ">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B003L20IFQ" />)<br />
This movie is a testament to how much can be done with so little.
Essentially this is one man, a phone, dirt and a coffin. What Ryan
Reynolds does here is make me believe that he's in trouble and imminent
danger. The tension in the movie exists right to the last minute with
what I'll describe as an unexpected ended. I wasn't expect it, at least.
Rodrigo Cortés makes a wonderful, basic and thrilling story, work. As an
added bonus, most of the released posers were incredible leading up to
the film. This is one that I was looking forward to when I heard about
it.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">5. The Social
Network</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004AJDE8C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B004AJDE8C">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B004AJDE8C" />)<br />
Another surprise movie, but it really shouldn't have been a surprise.
Look at the talent behind this - director David Fincher and writer Aaron
Sorkin. What they made with this movie was more than the technical
details (which is often wrong in movies to begin with). They made a
movie about the beginnings of an idea - and made that movie at exactly a
time when Facebook was in the news. You have great performances by
Eisenberg and Timberlake and genuinely interesting characters.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">4. Scott
Pilgrim vs The World</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00447850C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B00447850C">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B00447850C" />)<br />
The movie that practically every geek on the planet was waiting for,
finally arrived in 2010. And it was very good. For a movie about a guy
from Toronto, shot in Toronto this was a source of great pride to see
our wonderful city on display like this. Casa Loma never looked so good!
Well, it had me at Toronto. But, so much of everything else about this
movie is amazing. From the hyperactive action, to the performances by
Cera and Winstead to the sets to, well, everything else. A great movie.  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">3. Kick-Ass
</span>(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003LSTWES?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003LSTWES">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B003LSTWES" />)<br />
2010 was definitely the year for Toronto as a location. In this movie,
Toronto was the location - but the in-movie city remained unknown.
Kick-Ass, of course, was the introduction to super heroes without any
super powers. A new kind of comic book movie. And, wow, does it Kick
Ass. All of the characters were interesting and flawed and the humor of
it all made me laugh a lot. Also Hit Girl is someone you never want to
meet in a dark alley.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">2. The
Town</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840361/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0047Z94A6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B0047Z94A6">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B0047Z94A6" />)<br />
The one thing you'll be struck by with this second amazing directorial
effort by Ben Affleck, is the weight of emotion in all of the characters
here. Everyone in this movie is just excellent, from Ben Affleck to
Rebecca Hall to Jon Hamm to Jeremy Renner. This is a very character
driven movie about a small town in Boston and, frankly, the story just
blows you away. Not by how original the story is, but by HOW it's told.
I expect Affleck to get an Oscar or three for this one.  </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">1.
Inception</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B002ZG981E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZG981E">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B002ZG981E" />)<br />
Christopher Nolan is a movie-making genius. What he does with story,
sound and image is just incredible. Inception is on the top of most
people's lists this year because it is one thing - the best movie of
2010. The story is so multi-layered, so interesting, so visual - you'll
go back many times and still not fully understand what this all means. A
beautiful film in every regard. You'll also love how Nolan has made an
effort to use as much real and practical effects as possible - it shows
in the final product. I can't wait to see what he does next.  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Movies I
thought really sucked this year:</span>  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Shutter Island
</span>(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003ITZBR2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003ITZBR2">Amazon</a>)<br />
This one is moody and well-made and incredibly actied by DiCaprio - but
I felt the story was stupid. Really, I saw was was coming a mile away
and there was really no suspense to it. You can make garbage look
pretty, but it's still garbage right?  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Human
Centipede</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003L20IEM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003L20IEM">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B003L20IEM" />)<br />
Really, what were they thinking? That's pretty much what was going
through my mind every minute of this film. I essentially felt like the
woman at the back of the line on this one. Force fed fecal matter of a
movie. Brutal.  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Book of
Eli</span> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037705/">IMDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B003CN5S7M?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=facebook079-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B003CN5S7M">Amazon</a><img alt="image" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=facebook079-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=15&amp;a=B003CN5S7M" />)<br />
The book is a bible. Eli is blind. Really horrible movie.  </p>
<p>.. and probably many more that I can't think of. Better to bring in the
new year with positivity! Tell me what your favorite move(s) were this
year? Ho close is my list to your's? Did I miss anything?</p>
