    <p>My lord, it just so happens we push an all-time snowfall record on the
day the Cowbell come home. I was not going to let a little thing like
snow get in my way! I did not get to see last night's show in Hamilton -
and I missed all of the western tour.. So I was more than a little
bummed...<br />
<a name="more"></a>  </p>
<p>I get there after two hours of driving, already everyone but my sister
had dropped out of the night's proceedings, and to make matters worse -
I have to wait in some sort of lineup? I thought "What is this? Do they
not know who I am?". Well, they didn't, and I waited about 30mins to get
in, the lads had already finished the opening and a song.. I was so glad
to be back inside the Casa Cowbell for the first time this year!   </p>
<p>This was a packed house! The fans were pumped! it also appeared to be a
ticket with 7 other bands (as one of the very friendly bouncers would
explain). I was so much more in tune with things here than the last
time. The Jager girls were occasionally circulating around the stage
refreshing the front-row devotees, I was stuck a few rows back
double-fisting a couple Stella's...  </p>
<p>Bubba would do an uncharacteristically perfect rendition of "Tear You a
New One" - practice! The dancing girl looked great, she's lost weight,
but Sgt Rock seems to have gained facial hair - that makes them even?
You tell me. "Put The South In Your Mouth" gets interactive and then the
boys are whisked off... Seriously, I must have gotten whiplash with how
fast they spit!   </p>
<p>I did get to say hi at various moment, I had to let Charles and the
others know I had attended and then I was off myself. The very friendly
and drunk lady I met at the stage was all too happy to share the she'd
be married in a few days. Congratulations to you!!  </p>
<p>It was a short one, yes - but it was sweet to see the WCO again and I
look forward to this year's adventures!! What's next?</p>
