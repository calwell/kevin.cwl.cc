<p>As you probably know, I'm a sucker for a new project or something cheap
and cool. This time around I needed to find an end table to sit on the
left of the couch in the living room. I was thinking this may hold a
lamp or perhaps just hold magazines or a nice looking chess set. You may
not know this, but Side Tables are damn <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20176282">expensive</a> too. looking at
these things I was thinking (1) I don't want to pay a lot for the table
and (2) I want it to match the American Walnut stain of other tables in
the house - mainly because I suck at matching colors. With that, I went
out not specifically looking for a table, but keeping this in mind if I
came across it. And, boy, did I get what I was looking for!<br />

<p>On one fine October day I happened upon the Courtice Flea Market in a
small town just to the east of Oshawa. I had never been here previously,
but if I were to try and prepare you for this place - I would say it's
one big junk pile (I say that as affectionately as I possibly can). I
wasn't actually here to look for a table specifically - but I was
walking through an area with some interesting furniture piled up and
came across a small sturdy looking side table. The table certainly
didn't inspire much interest when I first saw it. The table had lots of
scratches and paint cracks. But, looking at it from afar, it was the
size I was looking for. I decided to get a closer look.  </p>

  The table when I brought it home</p>
<hr />
<p>As you see in the above picture, those cracks and scratches were quite
plentiful. When I actually went up to the table and picked it up -
that's when I decided I wanted it. The weight of the table was quite
nice, and, I'm not a person who is able to determined the type of wood
by picking it up - but this wood really looked like something I could
work with. I decided to talk to the lady about buying the table.
<strong>Sticker Price: $15 - Price Paid: $10</strong>.  </p>

  The various parts of the table</p>
<hr />
<p>I was pretty excited when I brought the table back - so much so that I
started to work on it right away.  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">#1 - Sand
</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">with</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">
90 Grit sandpaper</span><br />
After taking the table apart I used an orbital sander with 90 grit
sandpaper to get the old stain and finishing off the table. After the
first day, the table looked like this:  </p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ND7dT2FzfL8/TNs37zj7cWI/AAAAAAAAAig/7t4jE925DCc/s1600/SideTable.FirstDay.jpg"><img alt="image" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ND7dT2FzfL8/TNs37zj7cWI/AAAAAAAAAig/7t4jE925DCc/s1600/SideTable.FirstDay.jpg" /></a>
  After the first sanding, I wasn't completely finished</p>
<hr />
<p>There was something unusual I found after the first day, the wood used
on the top level of the table seemed to be different from the wood used
on the middle level. Also, it appeared as though the legs were using the
same wood as the middle level. The wood on the table top was more of a
thin wood covering with possible particle board underneath - not good -
I was going to have to take care while sanding this level.  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">#2 - Sand
with 120 grit sandpaper</span><br />
So, I was being rather touchy with the wood, but I managed to get the
first step done without any major damage. Also, learning from the <a href="http://blog.cwl.cc/2010/06/personal-project-coffee-table-sanding.html">last
time</a> I took on a table, I was very careful not to place any of the
sanded wood into or around water. This second stage of sanding went
quite smooth and quickly. The wood responded nicely to the 120 grit
paper as well. Also, I find that I tend to use half as much of the
higher grit sandpaper as I do of the lower grit.  </p>

  Sanding is finished</p>

<p>With the wood sanded the way I wanted - I moved on to the staining
stage. In this case I decided to use a staining pad for all of this
process - including the legs. Given the small surface area that needed
stain, I wasn't going to need much for this at all. The stain I used
(shown at right) was Varathane, with the "American Walnut" color. I made
it a point to keep all of the tables I've stained so far at the same
color. I was fond of American Walnut when I first saw it on wood, so I
stayed with it. You'll also notice that the can of stain is small - this
<strong>$8.50</strong> can of stain has so far been enough for me to stain a dining
room table, a coffee table and now a side table. Remarkable how much
this stain can cover. The key to staining woos seems to be the ability
to cover the surface in as uniform a way as you can possibly do. The
rest, will be dictated by how well you have sanded and the kind of wood
you have. I feel the better the wood, the better absorbed the stain is.
This is generally the most important stage of the process.  </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">#4 - Adding
the Finish</span><br />
With this step, I also used a Varathane product for the finishing. For
all of my tables, I preferred to use a glossy finish, but you may decide
that gloss is a little too shiny. I have been pleased with the Varathane
product, so I'll keep using it. For this table, I decided early on that
three coats was going to be enough - if the table looked like it was
going to need more, I would add more. It turns out three coats was more
than enough. It's a good plan to (if you're not sure) stat with three
coats and add as you need too. In between coats you want to use a pad on
the wood surface to pop any bubbles and generally let the wood dry for
at leas 6-10 hours. The longest I left the wood before another coat was
a day.  </p>

  After the first coat of stain</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">#5 - The
final product</span><br />
The the stain done, and the table dry enough, I put it together. you are
really going to want to leave a good long time (maybe a week?) for the
finish to harden before actually using the wood. So, here are before and
after shots of the table's ultimate location:  </p>

<p>That's it! Any thoughts? I hope this series of blogs might have also
given you some ideas about changing up some stuff you have around the
house. As always, thoughts and questions are more than welcome!</p>
