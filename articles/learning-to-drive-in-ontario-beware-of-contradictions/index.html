  <div class="article">
    <p>The process of learning to drive in an incredibly stressful one. From
reading about all sorts of hieroglyphic - looking symbols you've never
seen before, to being at the mercy of any one of the many questionable
driver trainers out there (I could probably be counted among them even
though I have good intentions). At some point, the process of learning
this massive undertaking may seem impossible, but it's not. Trust me on
that. What you can't trust is much of what you read either.<br />
<a name="more"></a></p>
<div>

</div>

<div>
A simple disclosure - I have been driving now for almost 21 years. I've
seen a great many things which I won't elaborate about here. What I have
also seen, is many friends and family going though the process of
learning to drive. One such unbelievable example is while working with
my sister Crystal as she was answering yet another confusing question.
This one related to how many demerit points are lost when you reverse in
a car without a seatbelt. Do you know the answer to that one?

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
Can you trust your Official MTO Driver Handbook to answer that question?
Let's see, I'm going to take the current version of this handbook and
show you.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">First, Page 29
- Regarding Seat Belts</span>

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
[![image][]][image]

</div>

<div>
Take a look at the above picture of page 29 of the handbook. It says
"Use your seatbelt always, even when you are sitting in a position with
an active airbag". Certainly seat belts are an important safety feature
of a car, and it would be reasonable to think you should be wearing them
"always". As a young driver learning this, you've read up to page 29 of
the "Official" Ministry of Transportation Handbook, so - more that being
proud of yourself - you assume this must be right. Right?

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
Now, I don't want to quibble with word meanings too much, but "always"
tends to mean all the time, or perhaps EVERY time. It's safe to say that
"always" would be a more definitive way of communicating "if your butt
is in the seat and the vehicle is moving, wear a seat belt".

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Next, go to
Page 55 - Regarding Reversing</span>

</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
[![image][1]][1]

</div>

<div>
The above is a picture of page 55 of the same handbook. It clearly
states "You don't have to wear a seat belt while backing up". This is a
clear and direct contradiction of previously stated "Use your seat belt
always". What is a person who might just be trying to figure out the
rules of the road do? Which is right? Why the intentional contradiction
in the first place?

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
The law does say this - in the Highway Traffic Act, the following
exemptions apply:

</div>

<div>
<div>

</div>

<div>
106.(5)Exemptions

</div>

<p></div>
<div>
<div>
You don’t have to wear a seat belt if:</p>
<p></div>
<div>
\1) You’re driving in reverse</p>
<p></div>
</div>
<div></p>
<p></div>
<div>
So, one of these two points in the Handbook is correct. Let's hope they
work to make this handbook clearer for the learners. We need better
drivers on the road, not more laws!</p>
