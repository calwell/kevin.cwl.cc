<p>This is one of a very few personal posts you'll see me write here. The
regular fare on this blog is usually a mix of computer, technical stuff
with the occasional outrage over something with a dash of vacation
stories added. After spending a little time over the last few days (re)
watching the 8th (and final) season of Magnum PI, I thought I would stop
and reflect on what that show has meant to me over the years. It's
almost corny now that I'm 36 years old that I would have identified with
a television character so much.<br />

To understand this, you really have to have a sense of timeline. Magnum
PI was in it's first run on TV from 1981 to 1988, this would have placed
the show on CBS in the rage of years for me from when I was 8 years old
to just about the middle of my 14th year. I was a kid in every sense of
the word when this show was running. Magnum PI was also a very popular
show - one of the higher rated shows for it's time. If they wanted too,
the producers of the show could have kept it going for some time after
it ended. But, in the spring of 1988, the show ended.  </p>

<p>I know what you're thinking, and your wrong. This show turned out to be
more than a show for me in a number of ways that go beyond some
pipsqueak kid watching the boob-tube. This is the unusual story behind
this show and it's effect on me when I was so young and it's apparent
effect on me now. As it turns out I'm in the middle of the years that
the Thomas Magnum character played out on the show (33 to 41). In many
ways its interesting, and sometimes scary to see this show with fresh
eyes as an older and (somewhat) wiser person - seeing things that the
kid could never have seen. I've also only seen the last season, none of
the 7 seasons that preceded it.  </p>
<p>There are so many coincidences that have happened in my life that have
linked me to the Magnum PI character. perhaps as a child, I just needed
a character to identifiably with - something akin to GI Joe for a
generation before me. But, there always seemed to be more.  </p>
<p>In 1984, as an 11 year old, my father decided to take me and my sister
to a baseball game. Since we lived in Sarnia at the time, it would ave
been difficult or impossible to get to Toronto to see a Blue Jays game.
We, instead ended up going to Detroit to catch a game at the Tiger
Stadium, watching a team that was on a serious tear that year and one
that would go on to win the World Series. This essentially became my
favorite baseball team as I followed the Tigers more and more as I got
older. I don't recall seeing the Magnum PI show at the time, but to see
that he was a big Tigers fan was really cool!  </p>
<p>There was the season when I finally started to watch Magnum PI in
first-run episodes. This being the last season, I was surprised to find
that in the final episode - they would use allot of Otis Redding's
music. I had heard allot of music from Otis Redding after seeing some
John Hughes movies years before and had become a huge fan of soul music,
and Otis Redding. I remember in the mid-80's, working in downtown
Toronto and after hearing Otis Redding for the first time - I wanted
that music! I remember walking up and down Young St searching through
all those classic record stores just to find any of his stuff. To hear
that music in the final episodes was an amazing coincidence, and kept me
watching.  </p>

<p>There were other things, that naturally as a kid, I would end up
emulating at the time. I remember walking around with a Detroit Tigers
baseball hat quite a bit - but I also remember at the time thinking "am
I wearing this because I'm a fan of the Tigers or because I'm a fan of
Magnum PI?". I guess it wasn't much of a big deal, but in the mind of a
young boy with no identity to speak of, it mattered to me. Seeing stuf
like the logo on Magnum's shirt as he would kayak - it was of a man's
head and the number of 14. Naturally I would find this interesting
because my own birthday was June 14th.  </p>
<p>Much of my younger years were a bit crazy, and having an escape like
Magnum PI actually helped me enormously. I found myself enjoying the
friendships between all of the main characters - Magnum, Rick , T.C.,
Higgins and the two dogs, Zeus and Apollo. The chemistry between all of
the actors was amazing - something we rarely see in today's polished
CSI'esque shows. As I would start watching the show more, I would see
allot of the re-runs as they were aired in syndication - but I never
managed to get to see the real narrative of the show as it was released.
In fact, not only have I not seen all of the 162 Magnum PI episodes, I
haven't really sen many of them in sequence either.  </p>
<p>And I get some of the in-jokes of the show (if you want to call them
jokes). I know that, for example, the number of 162 episodes was not a
random number - it's actually the number of games in a Major League
Baseball season. When I watch the show more these days, there are others
that I see too. It's amazing what you see, even after the years have
passed.  </p>

<p>Now that the show is entirely out on DVD (Seasons <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/dvd/Magnum-P-I-S1-Ff-Tom-Selleck-Roger-Young/025192471124-item.html?ref=Search+DVD:+%2527Tom+Selleck%2527">1</a>, <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/dvd/Magnum-Pi-S2-Ff-Tom-Selleck-Roger-Young/025192710322-item.html?ref=DVD:+CWBAB+Hero">2</a>,

them out, or at the very least buy me one of them. I have always
wondered how many other Magnum PI fans there are out there besides
myself. I did once come across a customer how had a model of the same
Ferrari that was used in the series too. Behind the model was a picture
of him sitting in a Ferrari in a setting that looked like Hawaii.  </p>
<p>This is the next step for me as a fan of the show. I would like to
finally get up and go check out the location where all of this was
filmed. I want to finally make the pilgrimage to all the various
locations to check out what it's like down there. After all of these
years, I have no doubt that everyone there has forgotten about this 80's
TV show, but I certainly haven't forgotten. I look forward to digging up
more episodes and checking them out. If you're a fan too, I'd love to
hear about why you are!</p>
