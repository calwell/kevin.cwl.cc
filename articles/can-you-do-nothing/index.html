<p>Today I found a wonderful and fascinating <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/03/04/doing-nothing-an-experiment-in-norm-breaking-2/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+SociologicalImagesSeeingIsBelieving+(Sociological+Images:+Seeing+Is+Believing)">post</a> on the Sociological
Images blog about the idea of doing nothing. That's right - just
standing motionless, with no facial expression, doing absolutely nothing
at all. The idea of taking 262 students, placing them in a public place
and have them just stand around like this (see video) seemed like a very
interesting idea. What are our reactions to seeing others break
society's norms and how do we feel as we're breaking them? How does our
norm of constantly being busy effect us as a society?</p>
<p>The experiment I mentioned was conducted at Georgia
Southern University by a lecturer named Nathan Palmer (see his
<a href="http://www.sociologysource.com/home/2011/3/2/doing-nothing-learning-deviance.html">post</a>). This happened locally at the campus and, from what it seems
in the video, the students were confined to a fairly small space. Take a
look at this short video:</p>
<p>What is doing nothing anyway? Try this: Go sit down on a chair or couch
and not pick up your phone, read anything, watch anything, or talk to
anyone. Try and sit, motionless, making no facial expressions, not
talking to anyone. You'll find that this is not only weird, this is
actually extremely difficult. Shortly you'll think of something to do or
your phone will ring or someone will call you. In our North American
society, one of the most pervasive social norms is our need to stay busy
all the time.</p>
<p>And even acting busy works. I worked at Burger King for upwards of 8
years and one of the things we were told to do when tending to a
customer is to look busy. Yes, there are times when we would have
nothing but waiting for something to cook, but you could go and grab a
bag, go badger someone about how quickly they're making a sandwich or
generally just walk back and forth erratically. This tends to work for
people, because, while they wait for something, watching a person "act"
busy makes them feel like something will get done faster.</p>
<p>Look at the example of an elevator button. Many of us will go up to an
elevator and press the button and stand there fixed in a stare on the
small screen that tells us where the elevator is. But, there are allot
of folks that will also continued to press that button with some sort of
intention that pressing the button repeatedly will make the elevator
move faster? Perhaps we do it just for something to do?</p>
<p>The whole idea of it being unacceptable in our society to do nothing is
underscored by our collective difficulty in maintaining a sense of calm.
I see many people everyday that can't seem to handle silence or have any
sense of patience (increasingly, this includes myself). When they have
to wait for an appointment, people need to have reading materials close
to them. When we wait in a line, we need to be using our smart phones
looking for updates of some sort. It seems as if our social norm of
being busy all the time my be starting to effect our health. I wonder if
there have been studies about this kind of thing? It wouldn't be too
much of a stretch to think that our need to be busy may correlate to
North America's <a href="http://notsomuch.org/2010/11/the-decline-of-mental-health-in-america/">decline</a> in mental health.</p>
<p>Despite the kind of blockbuster news it would be to find out that all we
need for better mental health is just slow down or stop sometimes; You
probably don't need to go far to see examples of moments when you could
have taken advantage of stopping and didn't do it. One of the biggest
examples of this for me was when I spent two weeks backpacking in Panama
a few years ago. The trip took me to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Blas_Islands">San Blas Islands</a>, a
beautiful set of islands in the north of Panama. The island we were
staying at housed a few travellers and one family that did the cooking
for us. The rest fo the trip involved no more than eating food, taking
the 5 minute walk from edge to edge of the island and sleeping in your
hammock. Rather quickly, the power on all of my electronic devices ran
out and I had no actual books to read. This would have been the perfect
moment to embrace doing nothing, but I tended to want to leave as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>As time passess, we all might benefit from using some of it to just sit
down, turn everything off and do nothing. Perhaps if more of us even did
nothing in public or while waiting for things, it would be less of an
unusual thing for people to do? Even more valuable for those of us that
don't meditate, the act of doing nothing may lead you closer to
understanding and even practicing meditation. Maybe not, but it would
make you one hell of a better driving companion on those long trips.</p>
